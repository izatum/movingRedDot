# Moving red dot

## Introduction
This is a game I made in school this year, it's nothing big, it comes packed with way too many bugs. The code is written with c++. I would not recommend you to not even remotely copy this. I used Raylib for this project, and I am aware of the use of if statements. I licensed this MIT because I have a hope a teacher might use this as homework for their students, in a "fix this code" type homework assignment. 

### Bugs
Enemies and the unfinished medpacks should spawn randomly, but they don't. My teacher was unsure about why it was happening as well, maybe some wild github pioneer will find this and fix the problem.

## What was this supposed to be?
Well at the time I discovered a brilliant game named "Bad Boro", I had an idea for a game but I didn't want to work with 3d graphics. That game made me realize you can make something really special like that in 2d graphics. And I really loved cult of the lambs 2d artstyle, which made me want to make a 2d game even more.

## The original idea
The original idea was for there to be many parts of weapons, imagine a giant scorpions tail stinger for example (Yes I know, a bit random), which can be used to make a sword and adds poison and has 10 dmg. And the swords handle would be a damage multiplier to the previous dmg.
#### 10 x 2.5 = 25 dmg, and posion dmg every second is dmg : 10 = 2.5 damage to the enemy every second it's afflicted with the status
There would be way more weapon types than just swords too, although I realized quickly I underestimated the challenge that would be implementing more weapons.

## My second project
I have been learning godot recently, and I realized all the quality of life it provides. So guess what will be my new hobby in the summer? Although I'm unsure whether we'll have coding next year, I think I'll stick to it for a while. I have yet a bit to do with my second project so nobody will see it quite yet. I will try to make a version of it that my teacher can see soon.
